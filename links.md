1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
An easy explanation to know what an Operating System is. The host spoke amazingly well structured and given in clear and easy to understand explanations.

2. [TutorialsPoint : AWK Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/awk_overview.htm)<br>
This site provide so many guides that is related to programming. I learned a few basic things from this page. I read the overview about AWK from this page and I will try to explore about AWK from this page.

3. [Vim for Beginner](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/)<br>
While in search of good text editor for linux cli, I find vim and I thinks this was pretty interesting choice, this website also give basic understanding of it.

4. [Disk Partitioning](https://www.partitionwizard.com/help/what-is-disk-partitioning.html)<br>
Disk Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more regions, the so called partitions. This website  tell us about advantage of partitioning and how to partitioning hard drive.

5. [Little and Big Endian](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first and  big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first.
This article tell us about little endian and big endian very clearly and there are some code that's used to explain this topic.

6. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html)<br>
Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes.
This website minim with UI but it serve us simple explanation that make us know the concept of memory allocation. 

7. [Concurrency](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/)<br>
Concurrency means multiple computations are happening at the same time. 
This article tell us about two models for concurrent programming clearly with illustration, so we can easily understand about this topic.

8. [Multiprocessor Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Multiprocessor-Systems)<br>
multiprocessor are systems that have multiple processors working in parallel that share the computer clock, memory, bus, peripheral devices etc.
This article tell about types of multiprocessors, advantages of multiprocessor systems, and disadvantages of multiprocessor systems. 

9. [Deadlock and Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br>
Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and wait for other resource held by any other process and Starvation is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time.
This article gives us illustration about deadlock process and table of difference between Deadlock and Starvation.
